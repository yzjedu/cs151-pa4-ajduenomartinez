### Objective:
#### What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
In this PA we were meant to create a program that could run multiple different analysis on different files as indicated by the user

### Procedure:
#### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
First I created an algorithm, and then I was able to create the code 
#### What were the Key concepts explored?
key concepts explored in this PA were the usage of reading and writing to files, creating multiple functions, and working 
with lists and tables
#### Did your results match what you expected to get?
results matched what I expected to get, so yes

### Reflection:
#### What challenges did you encounter?
I definitely struggled with figuring out how to append data to files, 
#### Did you overcome them, and how?
through trial and error, I was able to debug anc clean up the code
#### Any key takeaways?
Go over the code in the PA and use it to study for exam 3
#### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this PA?
I'd like to think that I have a pretty clear idea of how to work with files now
#### What was it like working by yourself?
Working by myself in this PA was a bit harder than the other PA's, given the scope of this PA. I was struggling a bit, as I tried
compared the code I was writing to the code I had in my lecture notes. Eventually, after studying for the exam with classmates, 
my understanding of the material increased, and I was able to debug the program until it worked.
